# League Mono
=============
_by [Tyler Finck](http://www.tylerfinck.com)_

**Eight weights of monospace fun.** 

League Mono is a mashup of sorts, inspired by some beautiful forms found in both Fira Mono, Libertinus Mono, and Courier(?!). 

League Mono was created for The League of Moveable Type using Glyphs app, with masters for the Thin, Regular, and Bold weights, and interpolated instances for the UltraLight, Light, Medium, SemiBold, and ExtraBold weights. This, unfortunately, is not supported by UFO files, which is why there is a Glyphs source and source files for each weight.
